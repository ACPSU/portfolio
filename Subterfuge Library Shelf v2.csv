But once we've successfully connected our devices to the internet, do we have any hope of keeping them, and ourselves, safe from the dangers that lurk beneath the digital waters? In If It's Smart, It's Vulnerable, veteran cybersecurity professional Mikko Hypponen delivers an eye-opening exploration of the best--and worst--things the internet has given us. From instant connectivity between any two points on the globe to organized ransomware gangs, the net truly has been a mixed blessing.

Drawing on examples from existing studies, we explore the role of simulations in generating new knowledge about probabilities and consequences in the cybersecurity domain, which is essential in understanding and managing risk and uncertainty. Additionally, we introduce the concepts of “bookkeeping” and “abstraction” within the context of simulations, discussing how they can sometimes fail and exploring the underlying reasons for their failures. This discussion leads us to suggest a framework of considerations for effectively utilizing simulations in cybersecurity. This framework is designed not as a rigid checklist but as a guide for critical thinking and evaluation, aiding users in assessing the suitability and reliability of a simulation model for a particular decision-making context. Future work should focus on applying this framework in real-world settings, continuously refining the use of simulations to ensure they remain effective and relevant in the dynamic field of cybersecurity.","2025-01-01","2025-03-24 19:16:22","2025-03-24 19:17:01","2025-03-24 19:16:22","tyaf003","","1","11","","Journal of Cybersecurity","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\jackz\Zotero\storage\ZBLCI6BG\Kianpour and Franke - 2025 - The use of simulations in economic cybersecurity decision-making.pdf; C:\Users\jackz\Zotero\storage\P8Y35MEA\8011238.html","","web","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study systematically reviews the literature on methods of detecting APTs by comprehensively surveying research in the area, identifying gaps in the relevant studies, and proposing directions for future work. The authors provide a detailed analysis of current methods of APT detection that are based on multi-stage attack-related behaviors. We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and conducted an extensive search of a variety of databases. A total of 45 studies, encompassing sources from both academia and the industry, were considered in the final analysis. The findings reveal that APTs have the capability to laterally propagate and achieve their objectives by identifying and exploiting existing systemic vulnerabilities. By identifying shortcomings in prevalent methods of APT detection, we propose integrating the multi-stage attack-related behaviors of APTs with the assessment of the presence of vulnerabilities in the network and their susceptibility to being exploited in order to improve the accuracy of their identification. Such an improved approach uses vulnerability scores and probability metrics to determine the probable sequence of targeted nodes, and visualizes the path of APT attacks. This technique of advanced detection enables the early identification of the most likely targets, which, in turn, allows for the implementation of proactive measures to prevent the network from being further compromised. The research here contributes to the literature by highlighting the importance of integrating multi-stage attack-related behaviors, vulnerability assessment, and techniques of visualization for APT detection to enhance the overall security of organizations.","2024-01-01","2025-03-24 20:23:58","2025-03-24 20:24:36","2025-03-24 20:23:58","tyad023","","1","10","","Journal of Cybersecurity","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\jackz\Zotero\storage\22JQW9Y5\Che Mat et al. - 2024 - A systematic literature review on advanced persistent threat behaviors and its detection strategy.pdf; C:\Users\jackz\Zotero\storage\RI93TH5D\7504935.html","","web","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
