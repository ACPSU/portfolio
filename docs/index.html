        Trying to fill out a whole web page is actually quite
            <strong>difficult</strong> Here is <a
                href="https://github.com/ACPSU">a link to my GitHub</a>, that will be useful. Also linking to my <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/digit100ajc/">wordpress</a>.</p>
        <p>Keeping these links around for ease of access <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3Schools</a>.
