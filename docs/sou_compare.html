        <h1>Comparing President Trump from 2016 to 2020 to President Biden State of the Union addresses</h1>
        <p>
            On this page I will show examples of how President Trump (2016 to 2020) and President Biden (2021 to 2025) use language. Taking note of how President Biden will use a more informal and friendly manner of speaking, in contrast to President Trump's formal and distant pattern. I will also show how different the surrounding context of these examples differ between the two presidents. The documents were taken from <a href="https://github.com/newtfire/introDH-Hub/tree/master/textFiles/state-of-the-union">this repo.</a>

        <p>
            Between these two there are a few noticable differences. Namely that Biden prefers using a more casual way of speaking in using contractions, while Trump will use a more formal and rather distant style. In using his more casual style, Biden also often follows it to clarify his stance; such as explaining how he isn't vilifying a group as a whole or isn't anticorporation, it is curious why he would feel the need to do this. Meanwhile Trump will almost always follow his "I am" with "asking" usually towards congress for a legislation he desires to pass.

        </div>
        <p>
            In total Biden uses "I am" across his addresses only 4 times, in these moments the phrase is used to bring more emphasis to his following sentence. Trump used "I am" 10 times more often, in total 40 times. Once again the most prominent use is followed by "asking," over double the next most common use. To me this shows really shows how both presidents use language differently. One choosing a more relaxed manner speech unless necessary to show emphasis or importance. The other using a manner of speech that is more detached, and less personal.

        </div>
        <p>
            The trend between these two presidents continues, with Biden prefering the contraction and using more relaxed and friendly speech and Trump choosing the full words and a more stiff and formal way of speaking. Biden will often use "going to" after "we're," typically describing his plan moving forward and in a way it is in a manner that will make a listener feel more involved, very typical of Biden's friendly speech pattern. In comparison Trump will also use "going to" but his way of speech changes who he seems to be addressing, leaving the listener detached and feeling as if he is only talking about his colleagues.

        </div>
        <p>
           In a final comparison I wish to take note of how Biden and Trump differ in the use of friend. Biden uses the word nearly double the amount of times Trump does, and is always referring to an individual. This of course aligns with his usual speech pattern, promoting a feeling of friendliness. Trump will instead use the phrase "friend or foe" or other forms that use "friend" to mean ally, except for one time he will never use it to refer to an individual. To an average person an ally is often not someone you are close to, not an actual friend who you spend time with. An ally is typically someone who helps towards your goal. This very much matches how Trump has been shown to speak.
