        <h1>The Review</h1>
        <p>
            I wish to start this review with something very important about myself; I am not someone typically drawn into games, as in getting lost in their world. I am very much a gameplay guy, ignoring everything else to complete objectives like a chimp looking for bananas. I say this so you can understand what I mean when I say the atmosphere in this game is excellent. The background noise, music, and visualizations are simple but incredibly effective. The first example of this is the main menu, has a very gritty short industrial tune. This matches the in-game visuals perfectly as everything is rusted, aged, and metallic.
