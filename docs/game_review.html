        <h1>The Review</h1>
        <p>
            I wish to start this review with something very important about myself; I am not someone typically drawn into games, as in getting lost in their world. I am very much a gameplay guy, ignoring everything else to complete objectives like a chimp looking for bananas. I say this so you can understand what I mean when I say the atmosphere in this game is excellent. The background noise, music, and visualizations are simple but incredibly effective. The first example of this is the main menu, has a very gritty short industrial tune. This matches the in-game visuals perfectly as everything is rusted, aged, and metallic. In speaking of the world, talking about characters can be just as important in drawing you in. To be brief, there are no characters in Carbon Steel. You receive emails from an anonymous source that will tell you about your duties and any gameplay changes for the day. You have a different anonymous person who leaves an unlabeled floppy disc that leads to a second ending, but neither are actually interacted with. This isn't a bad thing, it actually creates a very dystopian feeling. That you aren't really a person to the people sending the daily emails. The lack of any real characterization adds to the atmosphere of the game.</p> 
           <p> The player character is also not a character, merely the vessel the player uses to interact with the world. Even when facing death the player character does not react. I would say this adds to the atmosphere as well but in truth I think it's due to the dev not wanting to expend excess time where it isn't actually necessary to finish development. That isn't to say there isn't care or time given to this game's development, importance was just not placed on characters. Instead the care was given to the gameplay and atmosphere of the game, to me I much prefer this. As mentioned before the player character is just a vessel to interact with the world. To interact with any given object, click or press spacebar. A fun little tidbit is that when you interact with the in-game computer it uses your actual mouse to move windows and click emails and other buttons.

            Carbon Steel spans over the course of 3 days. The main gameplay loop involves bring up creatures from oncean depths, sedating them, and then extracting data from them. Each creature is asigned a class, sub-class, and the player is given the weight. Using this information the player uses floppy discs and a computer to figure out anethestic formula to use. There are 4 classes, each one on a separate floppy, and multiple sub-classes and weight for each. After the second day the the class and sub-class are hidden from the player, requiring the use of a tool to narrow them down. On the third day the player will have to repair the cage while doing everything else. This loop is so interesting and very fun, it's just so unfortunate that day 3 is the last day. It wouldn't be as disappointing if each day required multiple extractions but you only do one a day. This isn't a criticism so much as a desire for more time to play each run.

            As written above there are no characters and it is a very short game, clocking in at 30 minutes of game time if you're playing slowly. I would love to see this game get expanded upon as it is a very fun gameplay loop and with so many gaps in the world that can be filled there are options for a new game in this same style. I really do enjoy this game and it's a perfect choice for booting up and playing for a quick break from everything. It is over quickly enough that you don't get lost for hours, but deep enough to give some mental stimulation. I highly recomend Carbon Steel for anyone. Even someone who doesn't often play games will find it easy enough to pickup and play. If you're worried about horror elements I will say there is only moment where the player will see anything tangentially related to horror is a moment when going between day 1 and day 2, where you will see a fleshy pillar of eyes. Some may find that too much, if that is the case then yes I would pass over this game. If the imagery isn't an issue and it is more the game being described as a horror game that is stopping you then fret not, the player character is never actually placed in any danger during gameplay. It is a very relaxed experience despite the atmosphere and implications the game has. Once again I very much suggest playing Carbon Steel, and hopefully the dev or someone else takes this gameplay concept and expands on it.
