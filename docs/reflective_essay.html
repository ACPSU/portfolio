        <h1>WordPress is pretty bad, actually</h1>
        <p>After working with both WordPress and html using GitHub, I have come to the conclusion
            that I really do not like WordPress. In the time it takes me to get something to look
            right I could have added a so much content in html. WordPress in a way reminds me of
            game engines like RPGmaker. You can only do interesting things with them when you have
            sufficient knowledge in the language they use, html for WordPress and JavaScript for
            RPGmaker. The unfortunate part is with that knowledge comes the realization that they
            are oddly restrictive and you would be better off expanding your skills to more freeform
            options. As an example in the next paragraph I have a link attached to the word
            "here"</p>
        <p>The WordPress site certainly looks prettier than the one I made with html, but my website
            is just that MY website (you can view the WordPress <a
                href="https://sites.psu.edu/digit100ajc/">here</a>). With WordPress regardless of
            what I do, the website will always be a WordPress site. It ends up being rather
            stifling, I can not be truly creative with WordPress. Going forward any website
            development I do will be in html through GitHub.</p>
